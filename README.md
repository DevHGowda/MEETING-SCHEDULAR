# MEETING-SCHEDULAR
The proposed meeting scheduler Android application aims to provide users with a convenient and 
user-friendly way to schedule and manage their meetings. By offering various features such as storing 
meeting details in a database, displaying appropriate toast messages for different actions, setting 
reminders for scheduled meetings, and sending notifications to users, the application enhances the 
overall meeting management experience.
When a user wants to schedule a meeting, they are prompted to provide the necessary details such as 
meeting title, date, time, location, and participants. Once the user submits the details, the application 
stores the information in a database, ensuring that it is securely saved for future reference.
To enhance the user experience and provide real-time feedback, the application utilizes toast 
messages. These messages are displayed to the user based on their actions. For example, when a 
meeting is successfully scheduled, a toast message may appear saying "Meeting scheduled 
successfully!" Alternatively, if there are any errors or missing information, appropriate error 
messages can be displayed to guide the user in providing accurate details.
One of the key features of the application is the reminder functionality. When a meeting is scheduled, 
the application sets a reminder for the user. This reminder is triggered a specific time before the 
meeting, such as 15 minutes prior. When the reminder is activated, a notification is sent to the user, 
displaying a message like "You have a meeting scheduled in 15 minutes." This notification ensures 
that users are aware of their upcoming meetings and helps them stay organized and punctual.
Additionally, the application provides a feature to check if any meetings are scheduled on a given 
date. This functionality allows users to retrieve information about their scheduled meetings for a 
particular day. The application arranges and presents the meeting details, enabling users to quickly 
review their agenda. Toast messages may also be displayed to provide relevant information, such as 
"No meetings scheduled for today" or "You have 2 meetings scheduled for today."
The proposed meeting scheduler Android application offers a user-friendly interface for scheduling 
and managing meetings, with features like database storage, toast messages for feedback, reminders, 
and notifications. It enhances the meeting management experience, providing convenience, 
organization, and real-time updates. The improved UI ensures a better user experience and overall 
application performance
